## Instructions

5. Update will start running automatically. Do not unplug mouse during this process.
6. Once update completes, update window will close automatically.
7. Unplug your Model O/O- mouse and plug it back in again.
8. Your Model O/O- is now on latest firmware update. You may now run [glorious_software_setup_v1_0_9](/software/glorious_software_setup_v1_0_9) in [software](/software) folder. 

## Advance Functions

In the Model O/O- software, you will notice a setting called Debounce Time. The default value of this is 10ms. 

The debounce setting is an adjustable setting in the Model O/O- software that improves the mouse click latency. The lower the mouse click latency, the higher risk of double clicking. This setting is useful for playing around with if your mouse clicks start double clicking and other advance tests.

## Other Notes

If you have issues with saving settings to mouse, please run .exe as admin. Under Mouse Parameter, the option of Improve Pointer Precision is tied to your Windows settings. We recommend you disable this option for gaming.
